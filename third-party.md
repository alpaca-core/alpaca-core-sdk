# Third Party Libraries

> If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants. - Isaac Newton

Our software is powered by a number of third-party libraries. We are grateful to the authors and contributors of these libraries for their hard work and dedication. We have made an effort to list all the libraries we use, but if we have missed any, please let us know.

If you like our software, consider giving these libraries a star on GitHub, a donation, or contributing to them in some other way.
